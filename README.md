# Precise Recovery of Latent Vectors from Generative Adversarial Networks

This repository implements Zachary C. Lipton and subarna Tripathi's paper Precise Recovery of Latent Vectors from Generative Adversarial Networks, ICLR 2017 workshop track [arxiv]. https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04782

Most of the code in this repository was written by modifying a duplicate of Brandon Amos's DCGAN-completion-tensorflow project, which is MIT-licensed. Our modifications are also MIT-licensed.
The ./checkpoint_new2 directory contains a pre-trained model for faces used in the paper.
